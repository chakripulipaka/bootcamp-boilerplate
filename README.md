# Pawgrammers Pet Adoption Shelter

A full-stack web application for pet adoption management with user and admin dashboards.

## Backend Development Progress

### ‚úÖ Step 1: File Directory Setup and Dependencies
- Set up backend directory structure with models, controllers, routes, middleware, and utils folders
- Installed necessary dependencies:
  - bcryptjs (password hashing)
  - jsonwebtoken (JWT authentication)
  - express-validator (input validation)
  - multer (file uploads)
  - socket.io (WebSocket connections)

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Pet and User Models
- Created Pet model with required fields:
  - Name (String, required)
  - Breed (String, required)
  - Age (Integer, required)
  - Image (String, required)
  - Cost Range (Integer, required)
  - Personality Characteristics (String, required)
  - Additional fields: isAdopted, dateAdded, lastUpdated
- Created User model for authentication:
  - Email, password (hashed), firstName, lastName, role (user/admin)
  - Built-in validation and password hashing utilities

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Authentication and Login Frameworks
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system:
  - JWT token generation and verification utilities
  - Authentication middleware for protecting routes
  - Role-based authorization (user/admin)
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
- Created authentication endpoints:
  - POST /api/auth/register - User registration
  - POST /api/auth/login - User login
  - POST /api/auth/refresh - Token refresh
  - GET /api/auth/profile - Get user profile
  - POST /api/auth/logout - User logout
- Separate handling for user and admin roles

### ‚úÖ Step 4: CRUD Controllers and Routes
- Created comprehensive Pet management system:
  - GET /api/pets - Get all pets with filtering and pagination
  - GET /api/pets/filters - Get available filter options
  - GET /api/pets/:id - Get single pet by ID
  - POST /api/pets - Create new pet (Admin only)
  - PUT /api/pets/:id - Update pet (Admin only)
  - DELETE /api/pets/:id - Delete pet (Admin only)
- Created User management system for admins:
  - GET /api/users - Get all users with pagination
  - GET /api/users/:id - Get user by ID
  - PUT /api/users/:id - Update user
  - DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete user
  - PATCH /api/users/:id/toggle-status - Toggle user status
- Advanced filtering capabilities for pets (name, breed, age, cost, adoption status)
- Pagination support for all list endpoints

### ‚úÖ Step 5: WebSocket Framework
- Implemented real-time communication system using Socket.IO:
  - JWT-based authentication for WebSocket connections
  - Role-based room management (user rooms, admin room)
  - Real-time pet updates broadcasting to all users
  - Real-time user management notifications for admins
  - Event-driven architecture with proper error handling
- WebSocket Events:
  - Pet CRUD operations broadcast to all users
  - User management updates broadcast to admin room
  - Authentication and authorization for socket connections
  - Notification system for various events
- Integrated WebSocket broadcasts with existing API endpoints

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Backend Review and Coherence
- Reviewed all backend components for coherence and functionality
- Created comprehensive API documentation
- Fixed server startup configuration and MongoDB API compatibility issues
- All backend systems are properly integrated and tested
- WebSocket real-time communication system is fully functional
- Authentication and authorization systems are secure and robust
- CRUD operations for pets and users are complete with proper validation
- **Backend is fully functional and tested** ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Backend Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Server starts successfully on port 3000
- ‚úÖ MongoDB connection working properly
- ‚úÖ User registration and login working
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication and authorization working
- ‚úÖ Pet CRUD operations working (admin only)
- ‚úÖ User management working (admin only)
- ‚úÖ Filtering and pagination working
- ‚úÖ WebSocket server responding
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control working correctly
